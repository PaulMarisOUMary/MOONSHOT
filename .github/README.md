## Technical Specification for the Natural Disaster Prevention Application

### Architecture

The application will be based on a client-server architecture. The client will run on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, while the server will run in the cloud.

The client will be responsible for displaying the user interface and sending user data and requests to the server. The server will be responsible for processing the data and requests received from the client and sending back the appropriate response.

The server will consist of several components, including:

Data acquisition system: responsible for collecting data from sensors and other sources, such as weather APIs and seismic databases.
Data processing system: responsible for processing the data collected by the data acquisition system to detect patterns and trends that could indicate a potential disaster.
Notification system: responsible for sending real-time notifications to users based on the data processed by the data processing system.
Mapping system: responsible for generating interactive maps based on geographical data and recommended evacuation routes.

### Technologies

The following technologies will be used to implement the application:

Mobile development frameworks such as React Native or Flutter for the client.
Cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure for the server.
Real-time data processing technologies such as Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for the data acquisition and processing systems.
Machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for the data processing system.
Geographical data visualization technologies such as Mapbox or Google Maps for the mapping system.

### Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates the data flow between the client and server components of the application:
