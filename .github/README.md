## Functional Specification for the Natural Disaster Prevention Application

### Objective

The objective of this application is to provide real-time information about disasters to inform and prevent potential risks.

### Features

The application should include the following features:

- A real-time notifications/alerts about disasters based on their selected preferences and geographical location.
- Alerts should include the type of disaster, location, severity level, and if possible recommandation.
- Users should have the option to report disasters or potential risks they encounter.

Additional features:

- An interactive map to allow users to view risk zones with if available statistics.
- A section with usefull documentation about how to prepare for disasters and reduce risks to safety.

### Technical Features

The application should use the following technologies to provide its features:

Monitoring various sources to gather real-time information about disasters.
Data analysis algorithms to detect patterns and trends in the data.
Cloud services to store and process data.
Real-time notifications to alert users of potential disasters.
Interactive maps based on geographical data.

### User Interfaces

The application should have the following user interfaces:

A home page with general information about the application and the latest disasters worldwide.
An interactive map to allow users to view risk zones.
A user profile page to allow users to manage their notifications and preferences.
Real-time notifications to alert users of potential disasters.

### Constraints

The application must be capable of running on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
The application must be able to process data in real-time to provide real-time notifications and interactive maps.
The application must be secure and respect users' privacy by protecting their personal data.

### Conclusion

This application could potentially save lives by providing real-time information. By using technologies and different sources the application could provide real-time notifications and interactive maps to notify and help users in a disaster.

## Technical Specification for the Natural Disaster Prevention Application

### Architecture

The application will be based on a client-server architecture. The client will run on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, while the server will run in the cloud.

The client will be responsible for displaying the user interface and sending user data and requests to the server. The server will be responsible for processing the data and requests received from the client and sending back the appropriate response.

The server will consist of several components, including:

Data acquisition system: responsible for collecting data from different sources.
Data processing system: responsible for processing the data collected by the data acquisition system to detect patterns and trends that could indicate a potential disaster.
Notification system: responsible for sending real-time notifications to users based on the data processed by the data processing system.
Mapping system: responsible for generating interactive maps based on geographical data.

### Technologies

The following technologies will be used to implement the application:

Mobile development frameworks such as React Native or Flutter for the client.
Cloud services such as Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft Azure for the server.
Real-time data processing technologies such as Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for the data acquisition and processing systems.
Machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow for the data processing system.
Geographical data visualization technologies such as Mapbox or Google Maps for the mapping system.

### Data Sources

Users will be able to report disasters or potential risks they encounter.
The application will also monitor various sources to gather real-time information about disasters.

### Security and Privacy

The application will comply with all relevant data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union.
