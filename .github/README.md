# MOON

This README provides essential information including technical specs, functional specs, examples, and other related documentation.

## About

Moon is a programming language project designed to provide an intuitive and human-readable syntax.
The language is meant to be easily accessible to new programmers while offering flexibility and expressiveness for more experienced users.

The language is still under development.

Moon support indentation-based syntax, similar to languages like Python. This allows a clean and uncluttered code structure, emphasizing readability.

The project includes a lexer, a parser and an ast (abstract syntax tree), to translate the Moon language into a form that can be executed or further analyzed. 

Moon's syntax includes standard programming constructs like variables, expressions, and control structures, as well as some unique elements tailored to the language's design goals.

Whether you're learning programming for the first time or looking for a fresh approach to coding, Moon aims to provide a simple yet powerful tool for writing and understanding code.
