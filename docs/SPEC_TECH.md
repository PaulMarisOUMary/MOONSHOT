# Technical Specification
v 1.0

## Introduction

### Overview of the programming language

The programming language, codenamed "Moon Programming Language" is a newly designed high-level language that aims to provide an intuitive and accessible platform for both new learners and more advanced developers. It combines elements of modern programming language with a simplified syntax to encourage quick learning and productive coding. With a core focus on readability and ease of use, the language offers a comprehensive standard library, interactive console, and integrated development environment tools (IDE) to facilitate a wide range of programming tasks.

### Purpose and targeted audience

Moon is primarily targeted at children aged 10 and above, educational institutions, hobbyists, and anyone new to programming. The main goal of the language is to break down barriers to entry into the world of coding, providing tools that evolves with learners as they grow in skill and confidence. By offering a gradual learning curve and useful programming tools, it ensures that users find the learning process both engaging and rewarding.

### Relationship to functional specification

The Technical Specification serves as a detailed technical guide to the implementation, architecture, and operational aspects of the programming language. It complements the Functional Specification, which outlines the design, features, and core concepts of the language. While the Functional Specification focuses on the "what" and "why" of the project, the Technical Specification provides the "how," defining the underlying technology, standards, and methodologies to be used.
If you are reading this, you are encouraged to refer to the Functional Specification for a comprehensive understanding of the language's design and purpose.

## Architecture

### Architecture diagram

The architecture of this project can be depicted in a diagram that visually represents the core components and their interactions. The main components include the Core Engine, Interpreter, and Libraries & APIs. Here's a representation:
```

+-----------------+    +-----------------+    +-------------------+
```

### Main components

#### Core engine

The Core Engine is the heart of the language, responsible for managing the execution flow, handling syntax parsing, and controlling the overall operation. It defines the rules and semantics of the language and integrates with the Interpreter and Libraries & APIs to provide a seamless coding experience.

#### Interpreter

The Interpreter serves as the bridge between the user-written code and the underlying Core Engine. It reads the code, translates it into an intermediate form, and sends it to the Core Engine for execution. The Interpreter also handles real-time error checking and provides feedback to the user, making development more interactive and user-friendly.

#### Libraries and APIs

Libraries & APIs offer a wide array of pre-defined functions, modules, and tools that extend the functionality of the language. This includes built-in modules like list, dict, etc.., as well as interfaces to integrate external libraries or systems. They enable developers to perform complex tasks without having to write extensive code, promoting reusability and efficiency.

### Interaction between components

The interaction between these components is carefully orchestrated to provide a coherent and efficient execution process:

- User Code to Interpreter: The code written by the user is fed into the Interpreter, where it is parsed and translated.
- Interpreter to Core Engine: The Interpreter sends the translated code to the Core Engine, where it is executed according to the language's semantics and rules.
- Core Engine to Libraries & APIs: The Core Engine interacts with the Libraries & APIs to call any required built-in functions or modules, facilitating the completion of various tasks.
- Two-way Interactions: The arrows in the diagram represent two-way interactions, meaning that each component can communicate with the other. For example, the Core Engine may request specific functions from the Libraries & APIs and receive data in return.

This architectural design ensures that each component has a specific role and collaborates effectively with the others, leading to a smooth and responsive programming experience.
